# FarmBot
A Discord Game Bot developed by a couple of close friends

The basic concept is an Idle Farming game, where players can have *farms* from which they obtain resources they're then able to sell for money.

Any further suggestions for as to what the game should include / how the bot should operate are welcome!
(except there is literally no way for anyone to contact us, nor will anyone ever see this.)
